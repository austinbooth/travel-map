# Travel Map

Please note that this React app is currently in development. As well as React it uses React Map GL, the OpenCage Geocoding API and TypeScript.

Currently a world map is displayed, and a user can navigate to a specific location by entering a name. 

The next part of development is the addition of MongoDB to store locations along with photographs of my travels.
